# CSU33012
Repository for TCD Software Engineering 2019 Assignment 1 This assignment is mainly concerned with effective unit testing and git integration

In the initial Master branch the LCA.java and LCATest.java files contain the code and test for the first assignment (LCA in binary tree).

I created the directed_acylic_graphs branch to implement code to deal with Dag and tests to test it, I added this code to LCA.java and LCATest.java

I finished the assignment by merging the directed_acylic_graphs branch to the master branch.
